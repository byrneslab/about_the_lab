# Byrnes Lab Code of Conduct

## Overview
Here in the Byrnes lab, we are dedicated to understanding the forces that shape life in the ocean and what they mean for the ever changing world. To do this, we acknowledge our role in shaping a positive, vibrant, and inclusive environment where we can spread our love of knowledge and of the sea. With this code of conduct, we seek to lay out policies and norms that will enable those goals.

## The Quick Version

In our lab, we are dedicated to creating a safe, welcoming, and healthy environment to nurture the best research and researchers to move science forward. This includes providing a harrassment-free space and welcome anyone regardless of race, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, religious beliefs, socioeconomic background, nationality, or other categories not explicitly enumerated here. We are here for the work and for our love of science and the sea. Discriminatory behavior, dehumanizing and objectifying language or imagery in any context, or lack of respect of each other - particularly with respect to the aforementioned categories, has no place in this lab. Nor in science, really. We want to make the culture of science better, starting at home.

## Inclusivity and Diversity

Science has for too long been the domain of white able-bodied cis-gendered men. This has ramifications for the ideas and perspectives that can be considered within science and, moreover, means that science does not reflect society. How many contributions and stunning discoveries have been lost?

In our lab, we welcome and encourage the participation of anyone regardless of race, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, religious beliefs, socioeconomic background, nationality, or other categories not explicitly enumerated here. Moreover, discrimination against any of these will not be tolerated.

## Respect for Mental Health

Sanity first! Working in science can be difficult for one's mental health. We are constantly at the cutting edge, and failure is constant - both in terms of results of our work and rejection in the form of grant proposals and papers. In the modern university, we are also asked to wear many hats, often at the same time.

In the Byrnes lab, we know that your mental health is crucial for being a great scientist. You should never feel obligated to push yourself to be unhealthy. Take breaks. Go on vacation. Have a hobby. Read a book - the trashier the better! Cook elaborate meals! Send us the recipes! Do the things you need to do to have a healthy balanced life. If you feel this is not possible, have a discussion with Prof. Byrnes and other members of the lab.

We all work to be healthy and happy. Whether it's retooling your expectations of yourself or, heck, therapy (even Prof. Byrnes engages in it!), let's talk about it. It's the most important thing.

## Data Policy

## Publications and Authorship

Science is a team sport. We advance our careers through collaboration and intellectual contribution. Papers authored within the lab should recognize serious substantive intellectual contribution through authorship. When in doubt, discuss it with an eye towards generosity - particularly to more junior members. An undergraduate doing both intellectual and manual work on a project will benefit from inclusion in ways that more senior colleagues can easily forget. Further, we encourage all  members, whenever engaging in any form of collaboration inside or outside of the lab, to discuss authorship *first* before doing the work in order to make sure contributions are recognized if there is any doubt or if this is a new collaborative arrangement. Prof. Byrnes will work his hardest at contributing to all work going on in the lab and sign on as senior (i.e., last) author - but only if it feels warranted by those leading the work.

## Social Media

Social Media is a way to participate in the online conversation. It is a springboard to being a public intellectual which, frankly as public university scientists, we are! It also provides ample opportunities for communicating with colleagues that you might never otherwise encounter, and allow for scientific cross-pollination that can lead to great places! That said, social media is a place where you are constantly presenting a crafted version of who you are. It can also be a tricky sphere to navigate, rife with misunderstanding and others who are not plain dealers.

In the Byrnes lab, we encourage any and all members to participate in social media on whatever platform is most comfortable - or none at all! Your account is your own, and we would not seek to have it any other way. That said, while you are a member of this lab, we ask that you be mindful that your words, pictures, and actions can reflect back on your entire lab group. We ask for mindfulness in your use of social media. In particular, hate speech, threats, or harassment of any sort runs counter to our values as a lab group.

## Enforcement

Below, we enumerate our values as a lab. But, a statement of values without Enforcement is meaningless. In the case of a violation of any element of our code of conduct, please discuss it with Prof. Byrnes. He will talk to the responsible party - both to attempt to rectify the immediate situation but also to start a dialogue around understanding why this is an important tenant of being a scientist in the modern world. If the problem persists intentionally, this could lead to a more serious discussion of the member's role within the lab. At any time, if warranted, Prof. Byrnes is happy to bring in the chair, GPD, or other relevant element of the University administration. For appropriate issues, Prof. Byrnes is happy to consult with [UMB Office of Civil Rights and Title IX](https://www.umb.edu/crtix) or the [Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion](https://www.umb.edu/odei).
